Lexical Decision Task
--------------------------

The experiment:

	In this task, participants are required to judge whether a string of letters is a word or a non-word. This experiment is based on Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971) experiment. This experiment differs from Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971) experiment in following ways:

	 - participants are presented with one word/non-word in each trial rather than two words/nonwords
	 - participants are asked to judge whether the presented stimulus is a word or non-word rather than press yes or no (in the original Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971) experiment participants were asked if both of the stimuli presented were words or not)
	 - this experiment only uses high frequency words and their equivalent non-words
	 - words are between 3 - 10 letters long - there are 5 words of each letter length between 3 - 10 


To change the number of trials -> add/remove more trials in the excel file "experimental_trials"
To change the word/non-word stimuli -> change the trials in "words" column in the excel file "experimental_trials" (make sure to adjust the corrAns column accordingly)


Analysing your data:

	Data is stored in the excel file produced by PsychoPy in the data folder. response.corr column includes data from experimental trials. 1 represents correct response and 0 reperesents incorrect response. response.rt column shows reaction times for each trial.
